# Three Seagrass

> *“Three Seagrass had taken her hands away from her face, and the expression which was growing there was one that Mahit
had seen before: it was Three Seagrass focusing inward, preparing to bend the universe around her will, because all
other options were untenable.”
― Arkady Martine, A Memory Called Empire*
